Sex may give a boost to certain aspects of peopleâ€™s well-being and physical health, some research suggests. However, several studies on the subject are now outdated, and not all potential benefits apply to everyone.

Scientific research has highlighted several possible benefits besides procreation that come with sexual intercourse. These pluses include preserving heart health in some people, reducing blood pressure, and boosting immunity.

Sex can also improve mood, relationships, and mental well-being.

In this article, we look at the possible health benefits of sex and highlight relevant research, focusing on the physical rather than emotional aspects.
